# Medicare_Analysis
The purpose of the project is developing a working database for analytics, conducting ETL to load the data, writing SQL queries and visualizing the results.

# Descriptions
These data are from Medicare Shared Savings Program (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) and is provided to us by Bon Secours. 
According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) aims to encourage coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs. MSSP rewards Accountable Care Organizations (ACO) that lower growth in health care costs while meeting performance standards on the quality of care. Provider participation in the program is purely voluntary, and Medicare patients can seek treatment from any provider they wish. 
Bon Secours has provided us with two years of MSSP claims data for the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas. This claims data allows for complete, 360° view of patient encounters for Medicare patients assigned to the Good Help ACO.
The analysis we've conducted will revolve around hospital readmissions, in particular for the following diagnoses: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI), Heart Failure, Pneumonia, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), Stroke and Total Hips/Total Knees. Particularly we ultimately seek to determine if there are relationships between provided variables and readmissions that could be used to create additional interventions.  Particular attention should be paid to whether: 1) Current Length of Stay > 5 days and 2) They have seen their primary care physician at least one time in last 6 months 3) The number of Admissions in Last Calendar Year 4) If any of the following are true: Married, Living with Significant Other, Assisted Living, Long-Term Acute Care (LTAC), skilled nursing facility (SNF), Rehab.
Though we may not arrive at a complete answer to all of the questions in the previous paragraph by the end of the semester, it is a great chance to practise the skills we've learned in this class to organize the data so we can easily formulate these questions with queries and visualizations.


## Tools/Programming Language Used in the Project
In this project we applied integrated useage of several different data analysis tools: Mysql(data storage and data warehouse construction), Alteryx(data cleansing and indices computation) and Tableau(data visualization)

## Conclusions & Recommendations
Overall, this project opened our eyes to the numerous possibilities present when a large dataset with interesting information is available for manipulation and querying. The level of nuance and detail in the data we analyzed was apparent, and is obviously just the tip of the iceberg for providing a business with answers to its questions.
